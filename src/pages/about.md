Hello, My name is Victor, and I am a tech enthusiast. Ever since I was gifted a
desktop computer as a child, my curiosity of technology grew. I'd spent hours
playing online RPG games that I did not find it too challenging after a few
weeks. So I started looking into what I could possibly change to my newly
acquired desktop computer and make it more personal. I was changing
administrator settings so only I was able to access the computer, but that was
only setting up a password to the log in screen. At that point, I was feeling
more excited on being able to figure things out on my own. I moved on to the
network portion of the computer system and looking into the IP address, Security
and Firewall levels. I became so excited with technology that I started to read
about the latest technologies that were being created at the time.

Throughout the years, I was more tech savvy than anyone in the family that I
would be contacted for any computer issues that I may be able to help with. I
would get excited to receive any electronics as a birthday gift because I would
want to incorporate it to my daily routine.

Once I made into the college at Augsburg University in Minneapolis, Minnesota, I
was studying towards a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science. During the same time
I was in the U.S Army. Towards the end of my Junior year at Augsburg University,
I was given orders to Deploy to the Middle East and spent the year out of
college. Once returning back to the states, I decided to give myself a break
before heading back to school. During the process of setting up my return to
school -- Covid-19 struck. I decided not to head to school and decided to look
after the care of my family. Few years went by and the idea of me heading back
to school become less possible as the material held from the years of school was
no longer recognizable.

I did not give up and found the opportunity to attend Prime Digital Academy and
be able to learn so many new skills that I have not obtained through the 3 years
of college. I feel like was back on the pedestal to be able to fullfil my dream
in acquiring a job as a Software Engineer.

Never Give Up...
